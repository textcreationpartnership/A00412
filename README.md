1. •ovv that vve can neither tast of God, nor enioye any spirituall delighte and diuine comforte, yf first vve despise not the vvorld, and the Pleasures therof. CHAP. 1.

1. THAT PERFECT PEACE IS not fovvnd, but of the humble & meeke mynde, vvhiche is not gotten, but by mortification of our ovvne vvilles and by volūtarie suffering of vvordlie paine and tribulatiō for the loue of Christ. CHAP. 2.

1. •Y THE LYFE AND DEATH of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, it is plainly perceyued, vvhether the honour and riches of this vvorld ovvght to be esteemed or no, VVho being hym selfe vearie true god, both by his example and doctrine, teacheth vs vvhich vvaye they haue to take vvhich desire to goe the streight and direct vvay. CHAP. 3.

1. THE THINGES OF THIS vvorlde allthoughe in apparence they seeme good and delightfull, yet are they in deede full of falsehood and vanitie, and that for their instabilitie vvee ought not to putt any trust in them, lest that in the generall daye of iudgemēt vve doe in vaine repent vs, that vvee haue loued more those vanities, then God our Creatour. CHAP. 4.

1. VVHOSOEVER VVILL KNOVV hovv vayne these vvorldlie thing• are, muste not onelie consider the b••gynnyng of them, but vvaye vvith•• the end of them, vvhich is allvvay• accōpanied vvith bitternes & sorov•▪ CHAP. 5.

1. VVYSE MAN OVVGHTE allvvayes diligentlye to consider the end of his actions, to the intent that knovvinge the filthie ende that synne bringeth vvith it, he maye vvell take heede and bevvare thereof. CHAP. 6.

1. HOVV MAN OVVHGT NOT to muche to be aggreeued vvhen men doe murmure against hym: Nor reioyce ouermuche of prayses that be gyuen vnto hym, for before the face of God, the iudgemēts of men doe neither hurt, nor good. CHAP. 7.

1. SINCE EVERIE ONE OF VS must be iudged by God hym selfe, vvho is the onlie searcher of harts: vve ought not to make any reckenynge of mens vvordes, but labour to haue a cleare conscience before hym. CHAP. 8.

1. LET EVERIE ONE LABOV• to doe good onelie to please God vvit• all, and not for the desire of vvorldli• prayse, yf he looke to be revvarded fo• his vvell doinge. CHAP. 9.

1. HOVV GREATE A SYNNE vaynglorie is, and of hovv much mischeefe that is the cause: And hovv carefullie they oughte to auoyde it, that doe tend to the perfection of Chistian Religion. CHAP. 10.

1. •HE CONSIDERATION OF thyne ovvne vveakenes and defectes, and the greate labours vvhiche holie saints haue suffered here in the vvorld are vearie good remedies against vainglorie, the vvhich is vvont to marre all the good deedes▪ vvhich are vvrought by man. CHAP. 11.

1. ••VV LITLE A MAN OVVGHT •o esteeme hym selfe for greate in this vvorld, asvvell because that beinge in •hat state, he is in more daunger of favvlinge into synne: As also for that •he most parte of men, throvvghe the •piniō of their ovvne greatenes, forsake cleane the seruinge of God. CHAP. 12.

1. •HE GREAT BONDE THAT greate men are in, and that it is much better for our sovvles, that vvee be subiectes, then gouernours, because they haue to render accompte of the sovvles ••mmyted to theyr chardge. CHAP. 13.

1. ••NSIDERINGE HOVV •ITTLE •ime vvee haue to tarie in this vvorld, vvee oughte not to se•t our loue vpon any of these vvorldlie thinges, but haue •ur eye fi•ed still tovvard heauen, for •he vvhich vvee vvere created, and so •ughte vvee to vse these vvorldlie •hinges in this our Pilgrimage▪ as vvee •ay gaine by them the things celestiall. CHAP. 14.

1. THAT THE BEVVTIE OF TH• soule is more to be set by, thē the bevv•• of thy bodie, vvhiche is but a ver•• small thinge to be made accompte 〈◊〉 and therefore is thy mynde to be fixe• vpon the contemplation of diuine an• celestiall thinges vvhich ought onelie 〈◊〉 be loued and esteemed. CHAP. 15.

1. THE VVEARINGE OF G•••gious and braue apparell, is not co•••nient for a true proffessor of Chri•• Religion, cheefelye because th•• tokens of a vaine glorious mynde. CHAP. 16.

1. 〈◊〉 AT TRVE NOBILITIE IS •ot that vvhich the men of the vvorld •o much glorie in, that is to saie. The discending of noble hovvses, and from •uch Auncestours as vvere of singuler •nd rare vertues: But that is true no•ilitie vvhich euerie one getteth by this •vvne vertue. CHAP. 17.

1. •HAT RICHES BE AS IT vvere certain snares to catch them vvithall, that are in loue vvith them, and are content to be made slaues vnto them: And therefore they ought of a christian man to be dispised and contemned, and in the steade of them, the stable and suer riches of heauen are to be esteemed vvhich be full of euerlasting comforte. CHAP. 18.

1. THE RICHES OF THE VVORLD are declared to be but of vile substāce, And therefore vnvvorthye eyther to be loued or esteemed of a man vvho is adorned vvith so manye good gyftes by God, to the end, he sholde not abase hym selfe in the louing of so vile thinges, but sholde vvholie direct his loue tovvard his deuine maiestie, to be after partaker in heauē vvith hym for euer. CHAP. 19.

1. NO MAN OVGHTE TO BE proude, nor to glorie of his earthly possessions, vvhich doe further nothinge tovvard the attaynynge of vertue, but rather as hurtfull thinges they ovghte to be reiected and abhorred of vs. CHAP. 20.

1. MAN BEINGE CREATED TO the image and similitude of God, ought onlie to loue hym, and not these earthlie riches, vvith vvhich in deede he hath no maner of resemblance. CHAP. 21.

1. EARTHLY RICHES OVGHT TO be despised together vvith the desire o• them because they are heauie, and doe hynder a man that is clyminge vp•• tovvard heauen. CHAP. 22.

1. VVITH MANY GOODLIE REAsons and examples of gods frendes, he proueth that in this vvorld mournyng is better thē laughinge, And trauayle and payne more profitable then pleasure and solace. CHAP. 23.

1. GREAT VANITIE IT IS FOR A mā to gyue hym selfe vnto the pleasures & delightes of this vvorld, the vvhich doe runne so fast avvay, and vvhiche doe cause hym at last to loose the eternall ioyes of heauen, CHAP. 24.

1. ALL YOVR IOY OVGHT TO BE in God, for of euerie earthelie thing the ioye is vnperfect, But in hym it is so full that nothing can be desired more. CHAP. 25.

1. •OVV GREAT SO EVER ANY mans honours in this vvorld be, yet they all vanysh avvay at the last, and true honour doth only rest in the seruantes of God, both here in this vvorld, and in the vvorld to come. CHAP. 26.

1. ALL DESIRE OF VVORLD•• honour is to be fledde, for by them d• thou incurre infinite daungers 〈◊〉 losinge thy soule, and by them th•• are greate offences committed agai•• thy lord God. CHAP. 27.

1. THIS VVORLDLY PROSPERITY▪ ought much to be feared, for asmuch as many greate men of this vvorld, vvhich haue bene good and iust in aduersitie, haue yet in prosperitie bene founde to be full of vvretchednes and iniquitie, commytting dyuers offences, vvhich haue bene both against gods high honour, & their ovvne saluation. CHAP. 28.

1. THE PROSPERITIE OF THIS vvorlde gyueth shevve of the paynes and infelicitie of the next, And the persecutions and afflictions suffered for Christ, are sure testimonies, of his diuine loue, And of his chosing of th•• to be of the number of his elect. CHAP. 29.

1. VVORLDLIE FAVOVRS DOE keepe a man from knovvynge of hym selfe, and doe so dryue hym into pride, that he loseth thereby the grace of God, and his celestiall gyftes, except they be tēpered vvith humilitie & knovvledge of hym selfe. CHAP. 30.

1. •HE BEST AND THE REAdiest vvay for the vvynninge of Paradise, is to suffer persecutiōs and tribulations in this vvorld, & for that purpose be they sent vs by God, that vvee may be purged by them, as golde is purged by the fier. CHAP. 31.

1. OVR BEINGE OVER CAREFV•• for matters of this vvorld, (beside it shevveth diffidēce in gods prom••• made vnto vs,) it letteth and hynd•• vs, frō our spirituall exercyses vvi•• vvee ought most to attend vnto. CHAP. 33.

1. HOVV DECEIVABLE AND false the vvisdome of the vvorld is, vvhich iudgeth onelie by those thinges vvhich appeare good to the vvould, not considering hovv acceptable to God they be, and vvhat revvard they doe deserue, vvhiche for the loue of God dispise all those thinges, vvhich the vvorld holdeth most deare. CHAP. 33.

1. •HE VVISDOME OF GOD exceedeth all the depth of mans vvisdome, the vvisdome of the vvorld being foolishenes before God, and by the contemnynge of the vvorld is that other vvisdome gotten. CHAP. 34.

1. OVR LYFE IS SHORTE, AND passeth avvay like a vvynde, And it is lesse also then yt seemeth to be, for yt is no perfect lyfe, but a shadovv of the lyfe to come. CHAP. 35.

1. SO GREAT IS THE LOVE OF God tovvard vs, that this lyfe here being full of sorovves and afflictions, He of his goodnes hath shortened yt, that vvee may sone be ridd of these infelicities and miseries. CHAP. 36.

1. INNVMERABLE BE THE daungers, vnto vvhich this lyfe of man is subiect, and in hovv much higher state he liueth here, into so many more trovvbles and daungers is he brought by meanes of them. CHAP. 37.

1. THE TYME OF OVR LIFE being short & vncertayne, vvee ought not to prolonge our pennance, lest vvee be taken by death vnprovyded, and so svvalovved vp by the deuill in to hell. CHAP. 38.

1. A MAN OVVGHT TO CONuert hym selfe to God, and to doe pennance, vvhile he is in health, and not differre the doinge of yt vntill the hovver of death, for at that tyme pennance is many tymes vnprofitable. CHAP. 39.

1. A DISCOVRSE HOVV NO mā ought in this lyfe to put trust in any vvorldlie thinge, shevvinge that there is no assurance or stabilitie in any vvorldlie thinge, but all thinges in this vvorld are vnstable, and full of vanitie. CHAP. 40.

1. He shevveth first the vvorld to be full of deceipte, false shevves, and lyeng: and hovv it is enemy to all that loue it, lading all those that doe esteeme it, vvith infinite miseries and calamitie•. CHAP. 1.

1. IT BEHOVETH THEE TO BE vvyse and vvary, in knovvinge of the deceyts of the vvorld, lest thou be taken by the false shevves thereof. CHAP. 2.

1. THERE IS NO CREDITE TO be gyuen to the vvorld in any thinge, for all the fayre shevv that it maketh, tendeth but to falsehood, and fayned flatterie, vvhiche doe dravve a man from God, & doe throvv hym dovvne headlong into the depth of all miseries. CHAP. 3.

1. THE FALSE PROMYSES OF the vvorld are not to be trusted vnto, for it giueth the cleane contrarie of that vvhich in shevv it pretendeth. CHAP. 4.

1. THE MEMORY OF THEM that haue despised the vvorlde continueth: but of those that haue bene louers of the vvorld, the remembrance is soone gone avvaye. CHAP. 5.

1. THE VVORLD EXALTETH his frendes vvhyle they doe lyue, but vvhen their lyfe is ended, tyme taketh avvay all the memorie of them, as though there had bene none such. CHAP. 6.

1. HOVV GOOD AND DILIgēt seruice so euer a man doth vnto th• vvorld, yet doth the vvorld neuer remember it, neither vvill it knovv hy• that serued it: But vvill calle vvell to mynde, and haue in remembrāce, th•se that misused, and euill intreated it. CHAP. 7.

1. THIS VVORLD IS LIKENED to a tempesteous Sea, in the vvhich our Soules are tossed and turmoyled vvith infinite daungers, from the vvhiche there is no vvay to scape, but by retiring into the harborovvgh of pēnance. CHAP. 8.

1. THE FAVORS OF THIS vvorld be but as a shadovv that soo•• passeth avvay, And therefore they that doe trust in thē vvithout thinking of their soules saluation, at the last are likelie to rest in the fier of hell. CHAP. 9.

1. HE THAT SERVETH THE vvorld, not onelie hath no revvard of it, but also is kept by it in contynuall broyles & troubles, and at last brought to a miserable ende. CHAP. 10.

1. THE CONSIDERATION OF much bitternes that vvee fynde in the vvorld, (vvherein so little svveetenes is to be fovvnde, and that but onelie in apparence) doth gyue vs easelie to vnderstand, hovv heauie the yoke of his bondage is, and hovv much it is to be eschevved, CHAP. 11.

1. HE SHEVVETH HOVV there is no pleasāter nor svveeter thing, then the yoke of Iesus Christ, and that it is easie and light of cariage to those that doe loue hym, because he helpethe to beare parte of the burthen vvith thē. CHAP. 12.

1. IN ALL OVR TRAVAYLES and troubles, vvee must haue our recourse vnto God, vvith full hope and trust to be holpen by hym, and not haue any confidēce in vvorldlie help, vvhich is such as vvee can haue no cōforte by. CHAP. 13.

1. THE THINGES OF THI• vvorld doe passe avvay in that hast 〈◊〉 quicknes that the vearie considerat••• thereof might make a man to desp••• them, And seke to gett thinges of 〈◊〉 stabilitie and contynuance. CHAP. 14.

1. THE DESIRE THAT MAN hath to content his ovvne vvill, and to abounde in the thinges of this vvorld, doth cause hym to haue much care & trouble of mynde, vvhich neuer vvill let hym be quyet, but doth put hym still into nevv thovvghtes, & more anguyshe of mynde. CHAP. 15.

1. BECAVSE THAT ALL THE consolations of this false vvorld be accompanied vvith so many infinite sorovves and troubles, and are full of bitternes and greefe vvee ought onlie to loue God, and his eternall beatitudes. CHAP. 16.

1. THE VVORLD DOTH SO blinde his seruantes vvith the smoke of honors, and vvith the svveetenes of his delightes, that they setting their vvhole mindes thereupon, can not perceyue the deceyts thereof, nor the fovvle filthines of synne, vvhich they are drovvned in. CHAP. 17.

1. THE DEPARTINGE FROM this present lyfe is a most terrible and sharpe thinge to the louers of this vvorld, asvvell for their riches & honors vvhich they leaue behinde them, as for the paynes vvhich they knovve that they shall susteyne vvhen they be gone hence. CHAP. 18.

1. THE VVORLD VSETH TO gyue in recompence of long payneful seruice, short and false ioyes, and at las• revvardeth them vvith the fier of hell, and therefore it ought to be fled fro•, and God allmightie to be folovved, vvho for small seruice, and little trauayle, vvill gyue good and euerlasting• revvardes. CHAP. 19.

1. THE VVORLD HATH NO sooner aduanced those vvhich doe serue it vnto preferment, but that it doeth straight vvayes agayne forsake them, and so much as it exalteth them higher, so much the sorer falle doth it gyue them, and maketh them in a moment to vannish avvay vvith all the riches & honors that they haue gotten. CHAP. 20.

1. THE HARTES OF VVORLDlie men be so vexed vvith the insatiable desire of the riches, honors and solace of this vvorld, that eyther they perceyue not, or vvill not perceyue, the holie inspirations of God, by vvhiche he calleth on them to seeke theyr ovvne saluation. CHAP. 21.

1. HE SHEVVETH HERE BY sundrie examples out of the olde testament, and many authorities of the olde and nevv testament both, hovv the good are allvvayes persecuted, and the vvicked are fauored & esteemed. CHAP. 22.

1. HOVV INIVRIES OVVHGT patientlie to be borne and not to be reuenged, but the reueng to be committed into gods hande, for vvhose sake thou oughtest to forgyue all vvronges that be done vnto thee. CHAP. 23.

1. BECAVSE THE VVORLD IS f•ll of confusion, disorder and miserie▪ it oughte to be fled from, of hym that is desirous to fynde the treasor of heauēlie riches. CHAP. 24.

1. IN NOTHINGE DOTH THE vvorld keepe any assured stay, but cōtynuallie in euerie thing maketh nevve alterations and chaunges, & therefore ought not any man to put any trust in it, but onlie to place all his confidence in God. CHAP. 25.

1. HOVV EVERIE SINNE BE IT neuer so small, ought to be auoyded, & euerie occasion eschevved, that maye dravv a man into it, for one synne euer dravveth on an other, And bringeth still more daunger vvithall, to cast the soule avvay at the last into eternall dānation. CHAP. 26.

1. THE COMPANY AND CONuersation of euill men, is to be fled from, for the great daunger that good men doe stand in thereby. CHAP. 27.

1. THE COMMODITIES AND comfortes that are founde by them that keepe company vvith those vvhich be good, be great & many, as is proued by sundrie examples, out of the olde and nevv testament. CHAP. 28.

1. ONLY FOR THE LOVE OF God, and for the desire of obeying his holie vvill, ought man to despise the vvorlde, and the vanities therefore, yf he vvill that the despising of them shall serue hym for the gettinge of heauenlie glorie. CHAP. 29.

1. THE CONTINVAL REMEMbrance of death, and that our bodies must be turned into Ashes, is the perfectest, and the best remedie against the temptation of sinne. CHAP. 30.

1. VVHEN EACH MAN LABOVreth so earnestlie to bring any vvorldly busines to passe by some certayne ty•• appoynted hym, much more ought 〈◊〉 to labor earnestlie about his soules b•sines, and doe pennance for his sinnes, lyfe being so shorte, and the houre of death so vncertaine. CHAP. 31.

1. BECAVSE THAT EVERIE man sholde still be prepared, and that no man sholde take licence to sinne, our Lorde vvill not that the houre of our death sholde be knovven vnto vs. CHAP. 32.

1. THERE IS NO OTHER MEdecine so good against death, as the often meditation of death, for yt causeth a man so to lyue, as at the houre of his death he ouercommeth death and begynneth a happie and a perpetuall lyfe. CHAP. 33.

1. HOVV GOD SENDETH tribulation vnto man, to conquer pryde in hym, vvhich is the begynnynge and roote of all his miserie, and doth accompany hym that is subiect, vnto it i•〈◊〉 his actions and thoughtes. CHAP. 34.

1. OVR GREAT AND MIGHTIE God, doth loue humilitie in man, and therefore in all ages the humble be most aduaunsed, and the more that one doth humble hym selfe, the more nighe doth he dravve to God. CHAP. 35.

1. THERE IS NOT AMONGEST all the synnes vvhich doe reigne in the vvorld a vyce more hurtfull to mankinde, then couetousnes. The couetous man being cruell to all sorts of persons, and cheefelie to his ovvne bodie and his soule, and is of all men hated and abhorred, and doth neyther enioye this vvorld, nor the vvorld to come. CHAP. 36.

1. HE THAT VVILL BE LIBErall vnto our Lord Iesus Christ, in the person of his poore people, shall alvvayes abounde, & no necessarie thing shalbe vvanting vnto hym in this lyfe, and in the next lyfe he shall fynde, that he hath chaunged his noughtie money for good. CHAP. 37.

1. THE GREATEST MISERIES and calamities that the vvorld hath euer receyued, hath bene caused by the abhominable vice of lecherie & fleshelie lustes, from vvhich vvhosoeuer desireth to be kept free, and cleane, must flie all occasions of striuinge therevvithall. CHAP. 38.

1. CHASTITIE MAKETH A man to be beloued of God, and he hath alvvaies had those in great estimation, vvhich haue led a chaste lyfe, vvhich is gotten by chastenyng of the flesh, and flying from daungerous company. CHAP. 39.

1. THOSE THINGES VVHICHE seeme most goodlie to the vvorld, being compared vvith heauenlie thinges, be as it vvere nothinge, And therefore happie are they that doe consider it, And doe despise the vvorlde vvith all the vanities thereof, and ioyne them selues vnto Christ, of vvhome they may af•er receyue the revvarde of eternall lyfe. CHAP. 40.

1. All thinges of this vvorlde be false and vayne, and therefore they can not satiate our soules, but God onlie, vvho is our cheefe good of all, doth perfectlie satiate and fall all those that doe feede 〈◊〉•ym. CHAP. 1.

1. THE SOVLE BEINGE indued vvith reason, and created after the image of God, ought to delighte and reioyce onlie in hym, and of hym receyue perfect comforte. CHAP. 2.

1. GOD IS ONLIE THE FOODE of our soule, for he hath made vs onlie for hym selfe: and our soule beinge a spirite, it is vnpossible to satiate it vvith corporall thinges, because there is no conformitie betvvixt them and it. CHAP. 3.

1. VVHOSOEVER DESIRETH to finde rest let hym not seeke it in thinges of this vvorlde, for they be all full of trouble and turmoyle, but let hym turne hym vnto God, and he shall enioy quyetnes, and most happie tranquillitie. CHAP. 4.

1. THERE IS NO TRVST TO be had in thinges of this vvorlde, f•• at our most neede, they be gone avv•• from vs, onlie God is to be loued: a•• in hym is our trust to be placed, for •• neuer forsaketh them that trust in hym but is alvvayes a readie helpe for th•• in all their afflictions. CHAP. 5.

1. AS GOD DOTH IN GOODnes exceede all other thinges, so ought man to loue hym incomparablie abou• all other thinges, vvhich yf they haue any iote of goodnes in them, they haue it by participation of some peece of gods infinite goodnes. CHAP. 6.

1. THE LOVE OF THY NEIGHbour is so ioyned vnto the loue of God, that it is vnpossible for thee to loue the one, and to hate the other, And therefore it is a most sure thinge, that he vvhiche loueth not his neighbour, is condemned to perpetuall payne of hell. CHAP. 7.

1. FOR THE RARE AND greate spirituall profittes, that are gotten by louinge of our enemies, euerie good christian ought vvith all his harte to loue them, especially for that it is the proper qualitie of Christian perfection. CHAP. 8.

1. THE LOVE OF A MANS ovvne selfe, doth so occupy his vnderstanding, that yt taketh avvay cleane the knovvledge of God, and of his neighbour, and shutteth vnto hym the gate of euerlasting saluation. CHAP. 9.

1. THE TRVE PERFECTION of a Christian, consisteth not onlie in despisinge of temporall thinges: but he must also despise hym selfe, and vvholie deny his ovvne proper vvill. CHAP. 10.

1. A PERFECT CHRISTIAN doth not onlie despise honor, riches, an• euery other commoditie of this vvorld• but desireth also for the loue of Chri•• to be despised and contemned, and th•• good vvhich he doth, he doth it not f•• his ovvne spirituall comfort, but for th•• loue of God, and for to doe him serui•• CHAP. 11.

1. OVR SOVLE AND BODI• haue contynuall battaile together, 〈◊〉 yf the victorie happen vpon the bo•• behalfe, then are both bodie and so•• subiect to the cōdemnation of hell fi•• but if the soule obteine the victorie, b••• of them are crovvned vvith heauen•• glorie for euer. CHAP. 12.

1. A GODLIE INSTRVCTION to teach thee to knovve thy selfe, of vvhich knovvledge doth after grovve vnto thee, the knovvledge of our Lorde God. CHAP. 13.

1. THERE IS NOT ANY CREAture in this vvorld more poore and miserable then man, vvho can not get his liuinge, nor any thing perteynynge tovvard it, vvithout payne and trauaile, and that vvhereon he liueth must be had of creatures much inferior to hym selfe. CHAP. 14.

1. IT IS NOT SVFFICIENT onlie to knovve that there is a God, but requisite also for vs to vnderstande all such particularities, as his deuine Maiestie, vvill gyue vs leaue to knovve. CHAP. 15.

1. VVITH THE VVINGES OF meditation and contemplation a man ought to lifte vp his harte to loue the infinite goodnes of God, for perfection consisteth in loue, and not in contemplation. CHAP. 16.

1. HE THAT VVILL LYVE vvith Christ, must first die to the vvorld, the flesh, and his ovvne disordinate appetites and desires. CHAP. 17.

1. IT IS MEETE FOR VS TO mortefie and chasten our flesh, by absteynyng from meate, to the end, that vvhen our sensuall appetites be tamed, vvee may vvith more ease obey the spirite. CHAP. 18.

1. OVR EARNEST LABORING aboute earthlie affaires, doth turne avvay our myndes from deuotion and the seruice of God, therefore ought vvee to vvith dravve our selues vnto quyetnes and solitarines, the better to attend the saluation of our soules. CHAP. 19.
